# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Module 7 SQL
## Purpose:
To determine the number of current employees per their title, who are eligible for retirement, as well as determining current employees who were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955. Once the number of employees at eligible retirement age is determined we will know how many positions need to be filled. All employees born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955 will be considered for a mentorship program, so employees who are close to retirement age can help prepare other employees to fill their positions.
## Results: 
•	There are currently 300,024 employees in the company. 


• There are 41,380 employees who will be retiring within the near future.


•There are 1,549 employees who are eligible to participate in the mentorship program.	


•	Most of the retiring employees hold Senior positions in the company. It will be even more important to ensure that the employees who will fill their positions are trained well to ensure the positions contiue to be run smoothly. 


## Summary: 
o	How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
o	Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

As the “silver tsunami” begins to make an impact, 42,929 roles will need to be filled in the current or near future.
Currently there are 1,549 retirement-ready employees in the _departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees. As there are 41,380 who are eligible for retirement now. Between these two groups there is a possiblity that there will be enough employees to the next generation depending on how many would be willing to do so. If there are some that are eligible to retire now willing to come and mentor on a part-time basis, possibly mentor more than one employee at once than this could help lessen the need for concern.
